# Setting-up-Two-Factor-Authentication--2FA--on-GitHub-Guide
This repository is intended to guide users on enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for their GitHub accounts.

## What is 2FA in Github?
#### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a security mechanism that adds an extra layer of protection to your online accounts beyond just a password, It aims to enhance security by requiring users to provide two different authentication factors such as:
#### 1. Something you know:
This is knowledge-based authentication and typically involves a password, PIN (Personal Identification Number), or answers to security questions.
#### 2. Something you have:
This involves having a physical item or device such as mobile device, security token, smart card, or a key fob.

#### To log in with 2FA enabled on GitHub, you would enter your password and then provide the authentication code generated by your chosen 2FA method (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy or sent to you via SMS) .

#### Combining these two factors significantly strengthens the security of an account, even if a malicious actor obtains the password (something you know) they would still need the physical device or additional information (something you have) to gain access.

## Why to enable 2FA?
#### This ensures that even if someone obtains your password, they would still need the dynamic authentication code to access your account.
